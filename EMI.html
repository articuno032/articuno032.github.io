            <h3>Concept (Incomplete)</h3>
            <p class="special">
                    The following is a small incomplete concept.</br>
                    keep in mind this may be incomplete for a while.</br>
                    Any input on this project would be greatly appreciated.</br>
                    If you wish to help go here and apply: <a href="https://gamebanana.com/studios/35151">Achieve R&D</a></br>
                    I also plan to modify this concept as this project continues.</br>
                    EMI (An Efficient Mod Importer)</br>
                    Section 1</br>
                    Think of all the possible ways that a mod can be installed. i.e.</br>
                    through manual download</br>
                    through modboy</br>
                    other alternatives</br>
                    Different ways a mod is packaged i.e.</br>
                    In a folder in a zip</br>
                    to where a mod would be unzipped then extracted from the folder then put into the mods folder</br>
                    In a zip</br>
                    Just to where the mod would be unzipped and put into the mods folder.</br>
                    How to mark the file and make it to where the program can distinguish between the original and the mod i.e.</br>
                    Compare the mod file to the original</br>
                    maybe through the file size if there is a noticalbe difference in byte or preferably kb</br>
                    or comparing the images themselves to see if the look the same or not</br>
                    or the creation date between the mod and the original file</br>
                    Section 2</br>
                    a way to make the user take less steps to install a mod i.e.</br>
                    Find the installation folder then after that the user just drags the zip files into the program</br>
                    and the user has options like to replace overlapping mods or backup the save.</br>
                    The user also has the option to set up the program to automatically backup/replace</br>
                    allow the user to have complete discretion when using the program.</br>
