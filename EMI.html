            <h3>Full Concept Kinda</h3>
            <p class="special">
                    The following is a small incomplete concept
                    keep in mind this may be incomplete for a while.
                    Any input on this project would be greatly appreciated
                    If you wish to help go here and apply: M5 Industries
                    I also plan to modify this concept as this project continues
                    EMI (An Efficient Mod Importer)
                    Section 1
                    Think of all the possible ways that a mod can be installed. i.e.
                    through manual download
                    through modboy
                    other alternatives
                    Different ways a mod is packaged i.e.
                    In a folder in a zip
                    to where a mod would be unzipped then extracted from the folder then put into the mods folder
                    In a zip
                    Just to where the mod would be unzipped and put into the mods folder.
                    How to mark the file and make it to where the program can distinguish between the original and the mod i.e.
                    Compare the mod file to the original
                    maybe through the file size if there is a noticalbe difference in byte or preferably kb
                    or comparing the images themselves to see if the look the same or not
                    or the creation date between the mod and the original file
                    Section 2
                    a way to make the user take less steps to install a mod i.e.
                    Find the installation folder then after that the user just drags the zip files into the program and the user has options like to replace overlapping mods or backup the save.
                    The user also has the option to set up the program to automatically backup/replace
                    allow the user to have complete discretion when using the program.
